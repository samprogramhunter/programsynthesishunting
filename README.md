# Using Domain Knowledge and Novelty to Improve Program Synthesis Performance with Grammatical Evolution
---------------
This repository accompanies the paper with the title above, submitted for review to the GECCO conference.

All grammars used and the methods used to make them are in the grammars directory. Novelty search implementation can be found in the fitness directory, as well as the augmented fitness function. 

This repository is forked from and in large part the PongyGE2 repository. PonyGE2 is primarily a Python implementation of canonical Grammatical Evolution, but it also includes a number of other popular techniques and EC aspects.

# For full documentation of PonyGE2, see the [wiki](https://github.com/PonyGE/PonyGE2/wiki).
